## Overview

  This repo is built to showcase what I built in my time as a full stack developer at What The Truk. The source code for this project is closed-source, so I am including this README to demonstrate what I built on a high-level and the technologies I leveraged.
  
  All the features listed here were developed primarily by me, based on design direction from my supervisor, Evan Tousey. Evan also offered support and suggestions whenever I hit a roadblock in the coding process.

  What The Truk is a food truck app that allows users to find and order from local food trucks, and for vendors to advertise their menus, take online orders, and display their current location.

  During my time at What The Truk I contributed to 2 app's code-bases: 
  * The customer app - The app used for customers to find food trucks on a map and submit payments for online orders
  * Vendor app - The app used for vendors to update their food truck menus, view current orders, and enable their location for customers to find them.

  Additionally, I maintained and updated database logic. 
  I also and wrote code for a custom OAuth server, Google Cloud functions, and Mailgun automated emails.

## Challenges  
 
  This job asked me to learn and work **fast**. Within the first week of this job I had to get up-to-speed with a tech-stack that was entirely new to me. By the second week I was implementing new features, participating in code-reviews, and fixing bugs. This high-paced environment was not unfamiliar thanks to my time at Turing School of Software and Design, but it was challenging to have this level of responsibility for an in-production application with hundreds of active users.

## Successes
 
  I'm proud to say I grew tremendously through this role, both technically and professionally. I can now jump into unknown tech-stacks with confidence. I know I can learn what I need to in order to begin building new enhancements and making meaningful contributions to the code-base. I also was lucky enough to be mentored by my supervisor, who taught me how to better follow best-practices, write informative documentation/issue-tracking, and generally conduct myself in a professional manor as an autonomous developer.
